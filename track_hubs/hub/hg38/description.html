        <h2>About FUNCODE</h2>
        <p>FUNCODE (Functional Conservation of DNA Elements) is a computational framework that quantifies functional conservation between human and mouse regulatory elements using ENCODE functional genomics data. It leverages advancements in integrative genomics to generate numerous in silico sample pairs across species, eliminating the need for manual pairing.</p>
        <p>FUNCODE distinguishes between two types of conservation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>COnservation of Variable Activity (CO-V):</strong> Describes the conservation of tissue- or cell-type-specific activities.</li>
            <li><strong>COnservation of Baseline Activity (CO-B):</strong> Describes conserved constitutive activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>FUNCODE scores are available for four data modalities: chromatin accessibility (CA), H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac histone modifications.</p>

        <h2>FUNCODE Score Tracks</h2>
        <p>FUNCODE scores are available as genome browser tracks for both human (hg38) and mouse (mm10) genomes. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CO-V-(CA/H3K4me1/H3K27ac/H3K4me3): Conservation of Variable Activity scores for sequence-aligned elements.</li>
            <li>CO-B-(CA/H3K4me1/H3K27ac/H3K4me3): Conservation of Baseline Activity scores for sequence-aligned elements.</li>
            <li>GH-CO-V-(CA/H3K4me1/H3K27ac/H3K4me3): Gene Homology Conservation of Variable Activity scores for elements associated with orthologous genes.</li>
        </ul>
