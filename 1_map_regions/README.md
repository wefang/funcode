# Sequence Homology Mapping for FUNCODE

This step maps regulatory elements (e.g., DHS peaks) between species using pairwise sequence alignment. FUNCODE performs **bidirectional mapping** to create a comprehensive set of sequence-homologous regulatory element pairs (REPs).

## Overview

FUNCODE's mapping approach is highly similar to UCSC's liftOver tool - both use the same underlying netted LASTZ alignments. The key distinction is that FUNCODE maps summit positions (single nucleotide) and then extends to fixed-width regions, ensuring mapped regions are centered on orthologous regulatory element summits.

## Bidirectional Mapping Strategy

FUNCODE maps DHSs in **both directions** and combines them to create the final core set of REPs:

```
Forward Mapping (hg38 → mm10):
  Human DHS summits → Aligned mouse positions → 200bp windows

Reverse Mapping (mm10 → hg38):
  Mouse DHS midpoints → Aligned human positions → 200bp windows

Final Core Set = Forward Set + Non-duplicate Reverse Mappings
```

### Duplicate Removal
A pair from the reverse mapping is considered a duplicate if both its human and mouse elements overlap by >50bp with any pair in the forward set. After removing duplicates, the remaining reverse-mapped pairs are combined with the forward set.

## Input Data

### 1. Regulatory Element Peaks
- **Human**: DHS peaks from ENCODE (e.g., ENCFF503GCK)
- **Mouse**: DHS peaks from ENCODE (e.g., ENCFF910SRW)

### 2. Pairwise Sequence Alignments

| mm10 → hg38 | `mm10.hg38.net.axt.gz` | https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/vsHg38/ |

## Pipeline Scripts

### Forward Mapping (Human → Mouse)

```bash
# 1. Prepare human DHS summit coordinates
Rscript R/make_region_file.R

# 2. Split axt.net file by chromosome
# (preprocessing step)

# 3. Map summits to mouse genome
python py/base_run_hg38tomm10.py

# 4. Calculate sequence identity
python py/two_region_hg38tomm10.py
```

### Reverse Mapping (Mouse → Human)

```bash
# 1. Map mouse DHS midpoints to human genome
python py/base_run_mm10tohg38.py

# 2. Calculate sequence identity
python py/two_region_mm10tohg38.py
```

### Zebrafish Extension
For human-zebrafish mapping:
```bash
python py/base_run_hg38todanRer10.py
```

## Output
Each mapping produces:
- Paired coordinates (200bp windows in each species)
- Alignment block IDs
- Strand orientation
- Gap status
- Percent sequence homology (PSH)

## Comparison with liftOver

| Feature | FUNCODE | liftOver |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Underlying alignment | UCSC netted LASTZ | UCSC netted LASTZ |
| Mapping unit | Summit/midpoint → 200bp window | Arbitrary interval |
| Bidirectional | Yes (computed both ways) | One direction per run |
| Sequence identity | Computed and stored | Not provided |
| Alignment metadata | Block IDs, strand, gaps | Minimal |
