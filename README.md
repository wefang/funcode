### Output types on ENCODE data portal
These scripts produce data corresponding to two output types on the ENCODE data portal:

(1) "functional conservation quantification"

(2) "functional conservation mapping".

- "functional conservation mapping" is relevant if the user would like to map regulatory elements across species.

The following datasets contain "functional conservation mapping":
| Accession   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

- "functional conservation quantification" is relevant if the user would like to visualize the functional conservation signal in either human or mouse genome. Both '.bed' and '.bigWig' files are provided.

The following datasets contain "functional conservation quantification":

### Details:
To reproduce the FUNCODE scores, use the following steps:

1. Generate pairs of mapped DHS elements based on pairwsie sequence alignment (UCSC Blastz)

2. Download and process sequence read alignment files (bam) from ENCODE data portal

3. Integrate data between human and mouse

4. Compute FUNCODE CO-V and CO-B scores for sequence alignable DHS pairs

5. Compute FUNCODE CO-V scores for sequence DHS pairs with nearby gene homology, and calls significantly conserved pairs

6. Code to produce the score tracks in UCSC genome browser

7. Code to reproduce analyses in the manuscript

For details on each step, see README in the corresponding sub-directories.
